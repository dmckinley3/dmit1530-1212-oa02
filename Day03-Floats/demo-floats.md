You can follow along with your instructor to compare this build to the one you completed.

## Steps
1.	Download the **d**emo-floats.zip** file from Moodle and extract its contents to a folder named **demo-floats**.
2.	Open index.html in your browser to see something like:<br>
![floats-1](images/floats-1.png)
3. In your code editor you will see the following code:<br>
![code-01](images/code-01.png)
4. Uncomment the `float` and `margin` rules, save and refresh the browser to see:<br>
![floats-2](images/floats-2.png)<br>

5. Now change the float rule to float the image on the right:<br>

6. Save and refresh your browser to see:<br>
![floats-3](images/floats-3.png)
7. As the text appears to be butting up against the image, and there is a bot of a right margin on the image, make the following change:<br>

## Summary
Floats are only one way to reposition, or _float_, a block-level object on a web page. You should have learned **flexbox** in COMP1017, thus in future lessons you will explore more of what flexbox can do.
