            <h1>These are the dog days.</h1>
            <p>The dog days of summer are known to be the hottest and most uncomfortable part of the year – but they don’t have to be.</p>
            <p>Get away from it all by booking one of our luxury cabin packages today. Cool off under the cover of ancient boreal forests while taking in the majestic views of the Rocky Mountains and its glacial-fed rivers.</p>
        </main>

        <footer>
            <p>This website was created for academic purposes only. But it'd be pretty dope if you could book a cabin with a doggo and cuddle them for realsies.</p>
